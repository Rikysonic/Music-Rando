# KH2 Music-Randomizer (containing also KH1 and FFX music)
A mod for the OpenKH Mod Manager that randomizes the KH2 Music. It supports KH2, KH1 and FFX music.

## How to use:
* Install the mod using OpenKH Mod Manager
* Navigate to the OpenKH `Mods` Folder
* Open `kh2` folder
* Open `Rikysonic` folder
* Open the `Music-Rando` folder
* Run `Randomize.exe`
* Select the desired option (for new rando, it will ask you what game you want to include)
* Your music are now randomized!

## Explanation of meme options:
* **"DARKNESS MODE"**: Replaces every track in the game with "The 13th Struggle" except "Darkness of the Unknown I" (Dragon Xemnas - it's skipped in Randomizer, so it doesn't play) and "Darkness of the Unknown III" (final Xemnas)
* **"DARKNESS MODE - KH1 Edition"**: Replaces every track in the game with "Night of Fate" from KH1
* **"Relaxed Mermaid Mode"**: Replaces every track in the game with "Isn't it Lovely?" (Atlantica)
* **"I Love Traverse Town!"**: Replaces every track in the game with "Traverse Town" from KH1
* **"In Zanarkand Everywhere You Go"**: Replaces every track in the game with "In Zanarkand" from FFX
* **"Wait... is this a boss fight?"**: This meme option follows these rules:
  * All boss fight songs are replaced with a random silly song;
  * All other songs in the game are replaced with a random boss fight song;
  * Roxas boss fight song is always replaced with the Roxas theme (because why not);
  * STT is always replaced with Roxas boss theme (to prevent crash starting the last day, and also to continue the Roxas inverted themes meme);
  * TR is always replaced with Rowdy Rumble (to prevent crash on 3rd and 4th mini-windows)
