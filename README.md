## Explanation of meme options:
* **"DARKNESS MODE"**: Replaces every track in the game with "Darkness of the Unknown I" except "Darkness of the Unknown III" (final Xemnas fight stays vanilla)
* **"DARKNESS MODE - KH1 Edition"**: Replaces every track in the game with "Night of Fate" from KH1
* **"Relaxed Mermaid Mode"**: Replaces every track in the game with "Isn't it Lovely?" (Atlantica)
* **"I Love Traverse Town!"**: Replaces every track in the game with "Traverse Town" from KH1
* **"In Zanarkand Everywhere You Go"**: Replaces every track in the game with "In Zanarkand" from FFX
* **"Wait... is this a boss fight?"**: This meme option follows these rules:
  * All boss fight songs are replaced with a random silly song;
  * All other songs in the game are replaced with a random boss fight song;
  * Roxas boss fight song is always replaced with the Roxas theme
